	Oct 11, 2024: <b>Cross-Site Request Forgery</b> - high severity - not exploited - <a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/web/commit/d47a60b7d9943a5b5c8a37c3a96edd7ce94a319b">fix</a><br>
	A CSRF vulnerability existed, potentially allowing for account hijacking.<br>
	<br>

	Oct 11, 2024: <b>DoS due to Missing Rate Limits</b> - medium severity - not exploited - <a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/web/commit/7ae92e5f05c3c9008efa853e3e50b343f597493a">fix</a><br>
	Rate limits were not in place. This allowed for a DoS by repeatedly calling endpoints that run multiple FS accesses<br>
	<br>

	Oct 11, 2024: <b class="purple">7x</b> <b>Unsanitized input into path expression</b> - high severity - not exploited - <a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/web/commit/7c5a9fb723d3a912cd69e458a18953ae91762a6d">fix</a><br>
	Unsanitized values were passed to several fields in paths, allowing for users to potentially read/write arbitrary files on disk.<br>
	<br>

	Oct 11, 2024: <b>Clear-Text Transmission of Sensitive Cookie</b> - medium severity - won't fix<br>
	Session cookies can be intercepted by an attacker when sent over HTTP.<br>
	Won't fix as it only affects test environment (prod traffic routed through HTTPS)<br>
	<br>

	Oct 11, 2024: <b>Client-Side URL Redirect</b> - low severity - won't fix<br>
	Vulnerability exists in Nic Cage Eats Stuff game. Won't fix as this doesn't compromise anything important.<br>
	<br>

	Oct 11, 2024: <b>Vulnerable dependency</b> - low severity - not exploited - <a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/web/commit/0f1d1634295d84652171d96b4c80a775e92a83f2">fix</a><br>

	Aug 31, 2023: <b>Cross-Site Scripting</b> - medium severity - not exploited - closed-source<br>
	The title of Scribe pages was not properly sanitized before writing to a file, allowing for script tags to be embedded.<br>
	</br>

	Aug 31, 2023: <b>DoS</b> - low severity - not exploited - closed-source<br>
	When attempting to create a new site, the web server would loop indefinitely trying to save to a different ID. This made DoS possible by repeatedly creating many sites with the same names.<br>
