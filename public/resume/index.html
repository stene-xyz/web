		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		I am a self-taught software developer from the Edmonton area. I have full-stack experience, 
		but my strengths lie in backend and desktop development. I have a deep interest in the types
		of software most people never see - ticketing systems, internal dashboards, and the like. I 
		am a firm believer that these sorts of systems ought to be fast, reliable, extendable, and 
		arguably most important, well-documented. I aim to write code that can withstand the test of
		time, and I want to ensure that the software I create never tarnishes end-user or customer 
		experiences.

		<h2>Notable Projects</h2>
		<b><a href="https://drop.stene.xyz">drop.stene.xyz</a><sup>1</sup> - Frontend (HTML5/CSS), Backend (Node)</b><br>
		Drop is a simple, no-nonsense file sharing site. Drop a file, and share it to an unlimited amount of people for 48 hours. 
		<br><br>
		
		<b><a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/BSODView">BSODView</a><sup>2</sup> - Desktop (C# .NET)</b><br>
		BSODView is a small .NET application for viewing STOP error information from Windows systems. I developed this out of personal
		need - I wanted a small app that showed me the essential data I need to fix Windows issues. This app is just that - choose a
		drive, choose a crash, and immediately get all of the information you need to solve the problem.
		<br><br>
		
		<b><a href="https://github.com/jhonnystene/RM-DOS">RM-DOS</a><sup>3</sup> - Low-Level (x86 Assembly)</b><br>
		RM-DOS is a hobby operating system project written entirely in x86 assembly. It features a custom filesystem and a small amount
		of core applications that make it a fun toy OS. It is developed in my spare time to run on my old early 2000s ThinkPad.
		<br><br>
		
		<b><a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/OpenCodeReader">OpenCodeReader</a><sup>4</sup> - Desktop (C# .NET)</b><br>
		OpenCodeReader is a completely free application to read diagnostic trouble codes from vehicles. It is primarily geared towards 
		late '90s-early '00s GM vehicles, with support for talking directly to GM modules. This is another app created out of necessity,
		and is one I use every few months.

		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<b>Desktop</b><br>
		I regularly work with .NET to create cross-platform GUI applications. My tools of choice are C#, Windows Forms, and Visual Studio. 
		I also quite frequently find myself creating command-line tools (often just for my own use) and will use whichever language suits the
		task best - <a href="https://github.com/jhonnystene/RM-DOS/blob/master/tools/rmfs-insert.c">rmfs-insert</a><sup>5</sup> from the 
		RM-DOS project above is written in C, while <a href="https://github.com/stene-xyz/staples-dl">staples-dl</a><sup>6</sup> 
		is written in Python.
		<br><br>
		<b>Backend</b><br>
		I have written backend code in quite a few languages - I have experience with PHP, Node.JS, Python, and embedded C++ (with the ESP32).
		I have dealt with a handful of different databases - MySQL, MongoDB, and just straight .JSON and .CSV files.
		 
		<br><br>
		<b>Frontend</b><br>
		My frontend skills often result in a simplistic, but functional, UI design. I rarely ever work with a framework, instead writing CSS 
		from scratch to match what I need from every project. This results in pages that load quickly, even on a slow connection or a slow 
		device. As a strong believer in function before form, and as someone who deals with slow internet frequently, this is my preferred 
		way of designing webapps.

		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<h3>Staples Canada ULC (2022-present)</h3>
		My work at Staples more closely resembles IT support than software development, as I frequently need to repair devices or assist
		customers with operating them. However, I feel it is relevant here as it inspired my desire to turn "the system" from a curse to 
		a well-oiled machine that is completely invisible to customers, and it was the inspiration for several of my most well-written projects.
		<br><br>
		<b>Responsibilities</b><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Supported customers with IT related issues</li>
			<li>Repaired and upgraded damaged electronics</li>
			<li>Worked daily with internal ticketing systems and dashboards</li>
			<li>Maintained up-to-date knowledge on new products and services</li>
			<li>Sold products and upsold on warranties and accessories</li>
		</ul>
